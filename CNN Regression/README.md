# Convolution Neural Network ---> Regression

## Age Prediction
Input images are resized to 128 * 128 pixels due to limited RAM resources.
The model predicts the age of the person in the input image with a maximum error margin of 6 years.

## Home Price Prediction
House images are concatenated for input into the CNN, and then resized to 224 * 224 pixels for price prediction.
